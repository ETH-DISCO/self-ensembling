Implementation of "Ensemble everything everywhere: Multi-scale aggregation for adversarial robustness" by Fort et al. (2024) based on:

- Official repository by authors: https://github.com/stanislavfort/ensemble-everything-everywhere
- Andreas Plesner's reproduction: https://github.com/aplesner/Ensemble-everything-everywhere-recreating-results

Experiments:

- `0-custom-impl` (done) -> hyper parameter testing andreas' code
- `1-resnet-single-mask` (done) -> looking at train/tuning parameters for a single arbitrary mask
