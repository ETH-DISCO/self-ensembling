Implementation of "Ensemble everything everywhere: Multi-scale aggregation for adversarial robustness" by Fort et al. (2024) based on:

- Official repository by authors: https://github.com/stanislavfort/ensemble-everything-everywhere
- Andreas Plesner's reproduction: https://github.com/aplesner/Ensemble-everything-everywhere-recreating-results

Experiments:

- 0-custom-impl: hyperparameter tuning with improved version of andreas' code (done)
- 1-resnet-single-mask: same as `2-resnet-multi-mask` but a single iteration for testing (done)
