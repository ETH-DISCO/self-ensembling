- wait for most current experiments to finish

- wait for cifar 10 to finish
    - resnet: 951 (should take a day)
    - self-ensemble: done
        - download latents for cifar10 for plotting

# additional features

- resnet:

    - wait for resnet to finish
    - use models in `/tmp` folder to compare against more mask types 

- self-ensemble:

    - latent shift: we want to show how much classes have been "moved" by the attack
        - get 100 samples from each class
        - for all layers: forward to layer, then dump latents instead of linear probe -> stack latents for all images
        - repeat also with perturbed images (masks)
        - plot:
            - make tsne / umap plot
            - only fit to unperturbed images, not to perturbed images: https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transform.html
            - use color/shape to encode whether they're perturbed/unperturbed and the class
