- wait for most current experiments to finish

- plot as soon as cifar10 is done
    - resnet: ???
    - self-ensemble: âœ… -> you can also download the latents
- resnet: make exhaustive eval on masks by downloading (`scp`) pretrained models from /tmp folder -> you can also just take 5, and try to tell an interesting story

# stuff

latent shift:

we want to show how much classes have been "moved" by the attack

- get 100 samples from each class
- for all layers: forward to layer, then dump latents instead of linear probe -> stack latents for all images
- repeat also with perturbed images (masks)

plot:

- make tsne / umap plot
- only fit to unperturbed images, not to perturbed images: https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transform.html
- use color/shape to encode whether they're perturbed/unperturbed and the class
